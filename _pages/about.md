Li-Xuan (Alex) Peng is a first-year master’s student at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU), Taiwan, advised by [Prof. Min Sun](https://aliensunmin.github.io/) and co-advised by [Prof. Tsung-Wei Ke](https://twke18.github.io/). His research focuses on **physics-aware computer vision models and generative models for embodied vision**.

Before joining NTHU, Alex was a research assistant at the Research Center for Information Technology Innovation (CITI), Academia Sinica, where he worked with [Dr. Jun-Cheng Chen](https://homepage.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/pullpull/index_zh.html) on **adversarial attacks against generative diffusion models**. He earned his B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at National Central University (NCU). His academic excellence has been recognized with the Dr. Chu Shun-Yi Zyxel Scholarship, **the most prestigious undergraduate award at NCU**, as well as the Excellent Student Scholarship for outstanding academic performance.

Alex’s research interests span **computer vision, generative models, explainable AI, CogSci-inspired AI, and neural dynamic models**. He **aspires to pursue a Ph.D. at the intersection of computer vision and cognitive neuroscience**, aiming to uncover the fundamental principles of human visual intelligence.

Beyond research, Alex was a core member and instructor at the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) at NCU, where he led workshops on machine learning, computer vision, and cloud-based AI training. His experience in mentoring students and organizing technical training reflects his commitment to fostering interdisciplinary research and knowledge-sharing in AI.
