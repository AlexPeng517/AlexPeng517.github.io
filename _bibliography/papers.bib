      abstract={Diffusion Models have emerged as powerful generative models for high-quality image synthesis, with many subsequent image editing techniques based on them. However, the ease of text-based image editing introduces significant risks, such as malicious editing for scams or intellectual property infringement. Previous works have attempted to safeguard images from diffusion-based editing by adding imperceptible perturbations. These methods are costly and specifically target prevalent Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), while Pixeldomain Diffusion Models (PDMs) remain largely unexplored and robust against such attacks. Our work addresses this gap by proposing a novel attacking framework with a feature representation attack loss that exploits vulnerabilities in denoising UNets and a latent optimization strategy to enhance the naturalness of protected images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in attacking dominant PDM-based editing methods (e.g., SDEdit) while maintaining reasonable protection fidelity and robustness against common defense methods. Additionally, our framework is extensible to LDMs, achieving comparable performance to existing approaches.},

      author={Jia-Wei Liao and Winston Wang* and Tzu-Sian Wang* and Li-Xuan Peng* and Cheng-Fu Chou and Jun-Cheng Chen},
      abstract={QR codes, prevalent in daily applications, lack visual appeal due to their conventional black-and-white design. Integrating aesthetics while maintaining scannability poses a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-model-based aesthetic QR code generation pipeline, utilizing pre-trained ControlNet and guided iterative refinement via a novel classifier guidance (SRG) based on the proposed Scanning-Robust Loss (SRL) tailored with QR code mechanisms, which ensures both aesthetics and scannability. To further improve the scannability while preserving aesthetics, we propose a two-stage pipeline with Scanning-Robust Perceptual Guidance (SRPG). Moreover, we can further enhance the scannability of the generated QR code by post-processing it through the proposed Scanning-Robust Projected Gradient Descent (SRPGD) post-processing technique based on SRL with proven convergence. With extensive quantitative, qualitative, and subjective experiments, the results demonstrate that the proposed approach can generate diverse aesthetic QR codes with flexibility in detail. In addition, our pipelines outperforming existing models in terms of Scanning Success Rate (SSR) 86.67% (+40%) with comparable aesthetic scores. The pipeline combined with SRPGD further achieves 96.67% (+50%).},
